# This configuration file will try to read input from
# a V4L2 camera and output it as mpjpeg stream of pictures
# on the 'camera' stream and as a singular screenshot on
# 'camera_pic' shot-stream.

# It prevents the EBUSY error by creating an intermediary
# feed stream that connects to the device ONLY ONCE and, well,
# feeds the actual streams that are delivered to the clients.
# The amount of possible connections should now only be limited
# by hardware and kernel.
