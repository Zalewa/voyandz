# This configuration file will try to read input from
# a V4L2 camera and output it as mpjpeg stream of pictures
# on the 'camera' stream and as a singular screenshot on
# 'camera_pic' shot-stream. Depending on you underlying
# device, it may not be possible to have more than one
# stream active at the same time - connection to the
# device will faile with EBUSY errno.
